# React Dashboard Exercise

## Requirement:

Build a responsive dashboard

- Orientation toggle button: When this button is clicked, the page layout toggles between horizontal and vertical orientations.
- The design is responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Cross-device compatibility: Ensure functionality and appearance are maintained across different devices and browsers.

## Focus areas:

- Use CSS Flex-box or Grid for responsive design.
- Employ media queries for device-specific styling.
- Ensure usability and aesthetic consistency in both orientations.
- The dashboard must include a table component filled with mock data to simulate a real-use case.
- Free to use any component library like Material-UI (MUI) for UI elements, including the table.
